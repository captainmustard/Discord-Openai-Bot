# Discord-Openai-Bot
This is an AI-powered Discord bot. It uses the OpenAI API to generate responses and can also generate images using Stable Diffusion.

## Getting Started

To use this bot, you'll need to set up a Discord bot and an OpenAI API key. Once you have those, clone this repository and fill in the necessary information in the `config.toml` file.

You'll also need an instance of Automatic1111's stable diffusion webui running with the --api and --listen commands.

## Usage

The bot can be used in two ways:

1. Discord slash commands - Use `/computer` to ask the bot a question or `/txt2img` to generate an image based on a given text.

2. Discord message commands - Simply mention the bot and ask a question. The bot will respond with an answer and may also generate an image prompt if necessary.
